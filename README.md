About Changes : Changed background from Neutron theme to Full Black Background color, Homebutton changed from Neutron theme to default discord homebutton.

I customized this theme because it makes my eyes feel a little bit better then the default theme from discord, that's all no other reason. If you want to use this theme then you must know how to use themes or if you don't then you can watch a tutorial on "how to use BetterDiscord themes"

(It might make an html download first, if it does and can't download it then use this link https://github.com/SdkKKK/Black-Red-BetterDiscord-theme-/blob/main/Sdk's%20customized%20theme.rar and you will see a 631 Bytes file, download and you are good to go.)

Hope you enjoy this theme! ^_^
